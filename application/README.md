# Smart Parking System

## Overview

The Smart Parking System is an innovative solution to optimize parking space management using real-time data collection and IoT devices. This system helps users find available parking spaces in real-time, while also providing management tools for parking lot owners. The system leverages sensors, mobile applications, and cloud computing to provide a seamless experience for both users and parking providers.

## Features

* **Real-time Parking Availability**: Users can view available parking spaces in real-time via a mobile app or web interface.
* **Automated Parking Space Monitoring**: Sensors detect whether parking spaces are occupied or vacant.
* **Parking Reservation**: Users can reserve a parking space in advance to avoid searching for parking.

## Technologies Used

* **Backend & Frontend**: Next.js (React.js with API Routes)
* **Database**: MongoDB

## Installation

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (v15+)
* MongoDB or MongoDB Atlas account

### Setup Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smart-parking.git
   cd smart-parking
   ```

2. **Setup Next.js (Frontend & Backend):**:

   Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   * Configure the database connection (MongoDB URI) in `.env` file.
   * Start the server:
3. **Configure the Environment:**:

    Create a .env.local file in the root directory with the necessary environment variables, such as MongoDB URI and API keys for payment gateways.

    Example .env.local:
    ```bash
    MONGODB_URI=your-mongo-uri
    NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
    NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-nextauth-secret
    ```

3. **Start the server:**:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
 
## Usage

### For Users

1. **Sign up** on the website.
2. **Reserve a parking space** if needed.

### For Parking Lot Owners

1. **Login** to the admin panel.
2. **Monitor parking lot occupancy** in real-time.
3. **Manage pricing** and parking slots.

## API Documentation

The backend exposes a RESTful API that provides endpoints for parking space availability, reservations, user management, and payment processing.
